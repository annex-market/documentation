# Getting Started
{: .no_toc }

# What info must I send in order to get started?

## Node Name.

Ex. "York Region", "The Beaches", "Guelph"

## Operating Hours

Ex. 10am to 6pm, Monday to Saturday. 10am to 4pm on Sundays.

## Pickup Address

Ex. 718 Bathurst St. Torongo, ON M5S 2R4

The street address where customers who select "pickup" will go to get their
order.

## Service Area.

Ex. "Bayview & Eglington to Parkside / Keele & Waterfront"

What area shall we highlight on the map?

It's best if you can send us a detailed drawing w/ notes about which
intersections are at the four corners of your service area.

We'll work to convert it to lat/lng coordinates that can be displayed on the
location-listing prompt when a user visits an Annex Market site for the first
time, or when they switch nodes.

## Preferred URL

Ex. `york.annexmarket.com`, `beaches.annexmarket.com`, `guelph.annexmarket.com`.

A concise, hopefully one-word title for the subdomain of your store.

Note that we can also accomodate domain outside `*.annexmarket.com`, but you or
a technically inclined rep from your organization will have to coordinate with
us to set it up.
