# Listing Products

We'll provision and manage the technology that powers your annex market node.

Most nodes will run a Shopify store, with a special theme that gets auto-updates
with the rest of the Annex Market nodes.

You'll be empowered to input your own data by following the steps outlined here:

    Product details
    ===============

    The details you provide for a product affect the way the product appears
    to customers, make it easier for you to organize your products, and help
    customers find the product. You don't have to provide every detail for
    each product.

    For products that don't have any variants, the **Pricing**,
    **Inventory**, and **Shipping** sections are shown on the product
    details page. If you add variants, then those sections are no longer
    shown on the product details page. To change the details for product
    variants, see [*Editing variants for an existing product*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/variants/edit-variants).

    #### Note

    Although you can change your product details at any time, the changes
    can affect your reports. For information on how the changes can affect
    the way that products appear and are grouped in your reports, see
    [*Changes to product
    details*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/sales-report#changes-to-product-details).

    ### Title and description

    -   **Title** - The name for your product as you want your customers to
        see it.

    -   **Description** - The description for your product. This area uses
        the [rich text editor](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/productivity-tools/rich-text-editor) so that you
        can format your text. Describe your products in detail to inform and
        persuade your potential customers. If you're a reseller, then don't
        use a manufacturer's exact description, because you want your
        products to be unique to search engines.

    ### Media

    The images show your customers what the product looks like. For information
    on adding product media, see [*Product media*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/product-media).

    ### Pricing

    -   **Price** - The price that you're charging for the product. You set
        the currency on the
        **[General](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/general)** settings
        page. If you are [selling in multiple
        currencies](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/multi-currency),
        then click **Available in other currencies. Manage currencies** to
        view your currency settings. Click **Charge taxes on this product**
        if the product is taxable.

    -   **Compare at price** - The original price for a product that is on
        sale. When you enter a compare at price, the product displays a
        [sale price](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/discount-codes/sales).

    -   **Cost per item** - How much it costs you for the product or
        variant. For example, if you resell a product, then you can enter
        the price that you paid the manufacturer, excluding taxes, shipping,
        or other costs. If you create the product yourself, then you can
        enter a value that is based on your labor and material costs.
        &nbsp;
        For products that have a product cost entered unless you [include taxes in your
        prices](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/taxes/non-usa-tax-settings#include-taxes-in-product-prices) - the projected margin is shown below the **Price** field on the product
        details page. The margin is calculated as (\[price - cost\] /
        price) \* 100). For example, if your price is $50 and your cost is
        $30, then the margin (calculated as (\[50 - 30\] / 50) \* 100) is
        40%.
        &nbsp;
        Entering the cost per item is optional. If you choose to enter your
        costs, then add the amounts to all your existing products at the
        same time by using the bulk editor or a CSV import. By updating the
        information at the same time, you can get the most value out of your
        profit reports.
        &nbsp;
        Cost per item doesn't apply to gift card products.

    ### Inventory

    -   **SKU (stock keeping unit)** - The code that identifies the product
        within your business. For effective tracking and sales reporting,
        each SKU needs to be unique.

    -   **Barcode (ISBN, UPC, GTIN, etc.)** - Barcodes are typically used by
        resellers. The identifier needs to be a new or existing Global Trade
        Item Number (GTIN). Some sales channels require a GTIN before a
        product can be published using the channel.

    -   **Inventory policy** - The setting for [inventory tracking](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/inventory).

    ### Shipping

    -   **This is a physical product** - The setting for whether a product
        needs to be shipped. Uncheck it for digital products or services, or
        for products that you never ship.

    -   **Weight** - The product's actual weight. Product weight needs
        to be exact because it may be used to calculate shipping rates in the
        future, and it is shown to customers on the front end.

    ### Variants

    For a product that has variants, this section shows the options for the
    product, such as color and size. For more information about variants,
    see [*Variants*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/variants).

    ### Product availability

    A list of your active sales channels where you can make the product
    available. To edit sales channel availability, click **Manage**. For
    more information about products and sales channels, see [*Make products
    available on your sales
    channels*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/add-update-products#make-products-available-on-your-sales-channels).

    You can't set sales channel availability for individual product
    variants.

    ### Organization

    -   **Product type** - A category for the product that you can use to
        manage your products. For example, you can use the product type as a
        condition for an [automated collection](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections/automated-collections), or to help you filter your products
        in the Shopify admin. A product can have only one product type.
        &nbsp;
        You can choose from any defined product type, or create a new one.
        To create a product type, enter it into the **Product type** field
        and then save the product. You can also create and edit product
        types in the [bulk editor](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/productivity-tools/bulk-editing-products).

    -   **Vendor** - The manufacturer, wholesaler, or other vendor for the
        product. You can filter your product list by vendor, which can speed
        up ordering inventory.

    -   **Collections** - The collections that a product is included in. You
        can use this field to add the product directly to [a manual collection](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection#create-a-manual-collection).
        Automated collections include the product when it matches the collection
        conditions.

    -   **Tags** - Tags are searchable keywords that you can associate with
        your product. Tags can help customers find your product through your
        online store search, and you can also use them to create [automated
        collections](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections/automated-collections/auto-select).
        &nbsp;
        For more information about tags, see [*Tag formats*](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/details/tags).
